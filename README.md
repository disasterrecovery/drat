# D.R.A.T.
### Disaster Recovery Assistance Tool

This application is a datastore of programs and services that provide technical or financial aid in the event of a disaster.
The resources are categorized by the type of aid they provide, their specific region, a specific disaster, and the entities the resource caters to.

### API
DRAT has a JSON API available to the public.

### Technology
DRAT was built with Ruby on Rails and Postgres. ActiveAdmin is utilized for a simple admin interface and Grape is used as a mounted Rails engine for the API.

### Who?
With some direction from the Colorado Department of Public Safety, this project was started during the 2013 [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) at the [Boulder Civic Hackfest](http://bouldercivichackfest.org/). The primary development was done by @tbeseda and @rylanb.

### TODO
DRAT is very much a work in progress, and hasn't been deployed to a permanent location or seeded with a proper list of resources.
